        <h2>What is Amanuensis?</h2>
        <p>
          Amanuensis is a Chrome extension that facilitates taking notes on
          phrases you find as you browse the web. It captures the phrase, its
          context &mdash; the surrounding text &mdash; the time you recorded it,
          the URL, and any tags and notes, either on the phrase generally or
          particular citations. You can link notes together, search for them,
          export them, or merge exports.
        </p>
        <p>
          In principal, you can use Amanuensis to take any sort of note. It was
          designed, however, with language learning in mind.
        </p>
        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          When people learn languages in a classroom, most context is removed.
          Words are learned in lists and are taught when the textbook or
          professor deems best, not when the student is interested. But learning
          facts unconnected to your interests is inefficient. You if you don't
          already want to know the answer, the answer doesn't sink in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea with Amanuensis is that you find something which is
          inherently interesting to you and you try to read it. When you come
          across unfamiliar words, you will be more likely to remember them,
          because you <i>want</i> to know what they mean.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you come across the words again, and look them up again, as one
          does, you will be reminded of the last context in which you saw the
          word. The words will all hang together in a web of meaning and
          association.
        </p>
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>
          I have written Amanuensis because it is the language learning tool I
          want. I am sharing it because, having written it, it costs me nothing
          to do so. It is free. It will remain free. I have no plans to make
          money off of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, for the same reason I cannot guarantee it will be supported
          and developed forever. I will keep working on it as long as I have use
          for it. Since I love learning languages, I will keep at it for
          decades, as long as I keep my health. But Amanuensis has a bus number
          of one. If support drops off, something bad has happened. But I
          imagine it will keep working, just without additional bells and
          whistles.
        </p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>
          For the time being the only way to install Amanuensis is to
          <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository"
            >clone the repository</a
          >, run the compile script, and
          <a
            href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked"
            >load the unpacked extension into chrome</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The respository is at
          <a href="https://github.com/dfhoughton/amanuensis-2"
            >https://github.com/dfhoughton/amanuensis-2</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          To run the build script, you must have
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">installed node</a>. Then, in
          a terminal, cd to the install directory and run
          <code>npm run release-build</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once things are more buttoned up I will submit Amanuensis to the
          chrome store. An earlier incarnation of it was there before. Then one
          will be able to install it as one does any chrome extension. The
          instructions above will continue to work.

        <h2>Dedication</h2>
        <p>
          Amanuensis, like most of my projects, is dedicated to my son Jude, who
          died on February 1st, 2023. He was a better programmer and a better,
          kinder, more interesting person than me. I was looking forwarde to
          being surprised and amazed by him as he went out into the world. He
          shared repositories in github under the name
          <a href="https://github.com/TurkeyMcMac">TurkeyMcMac</a>.
        </p>
        <p>We love you and miss you, Jude.</p>
