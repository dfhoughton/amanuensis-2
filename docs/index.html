        <h2>What is Amanuensis?</h2>
        <p>
          Amanuensis is a Chrome extension that facilitates taking notes on
          phrases you find as you browse the web. It captures the phrase, its
          context &mdash; the surrounding text &mdash; the time you recorded it,
          the URL, and any tags and notes, either on the phrase generally or
          particular citations. You can link notes together, edit them, merge
          them, search for them, export them, or import them from an export.
        </p>
        <p>
          In principal, you can use Amanuensis to take any sort of note. It was
          designed, however, with language learning in mind.
        </p>
        <h3>Use</h3>
        <p>
          The general pattern of usage: You're reading an article on something
          that interests you. You find a phrase of particular interest. If
          you're using Amanuensis to learn a language, it's an unfamiliar phrase
          or idiom. If you're using it as a research tool, it's a fact,
          observation, or data point. You highlight the phrase and click the
          Amanuensis icon or press ctrl-shift-A to start a note.<span class="fn"
            >If you are studying a language, you will need some other source to
            provide definitions, part of speech, etc. I find
            <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page"
              >wiktionary</a
            >
            is a great resource. It provides you considerably more and more
            trustworthy information than you get from Google Translate, for
            instance.</span
          >
          You add relevant information, perhaps some tags; you look for similar
          or related notes and link them. You save it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, you wish to continue with an article. Say it's the last
          article. You click the icon or press ctrl-shift-A and open Amanuensis.
          You search, sorting for the most recently updated note. You click on
          the first note, then click on the URL. This takes you to the page,
          highlighting the phrase. You click on the search tab and see a list of
          all the notes you took on the page.
        </p>
        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          When people learn languages in a classroom, most context is removed.
          Words are learned in lists and are taught when the textbook or
          professor deems best, not when the student is interested. But learning
          facts unconnected to your interests is inefficient. If you don't
          already want to know the answer, the answer doesn't sink in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea with Amanuensis is that you find something which is
          inherently interesting to you and you try to read it. When you come
          across unfamiliar words, you will be more likely to remember them,
          because you <i>want</i> to know what they mean.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you come across the words again, and look them up again, as one
          does, you will be reminded of the last context in which you saw the
          word. The words will all hang together in a web of meaning and
          association.
        </p>
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>
          I have written Amanuensis because it is the language learning tool I
          want. I am sharing it because, having written it, it costs me nothing
          to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is free. It will remain free. I have no plans to make money off of
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, for the same reason I cannot guarantee it will be supported
          and developed forever. I will keep working on it as long as I have use
          for it. Since I love learning languages, I will keep at it for
          decades, as long as I keep my health. But Amanuensis has a bus number
          of one. If support drops off, something bad has happened. Still, I
          imagine it will keep working, just without additional bells and
          whistles.
        </p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>
          For the time being the only way to install Amanuensis is to
          <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository"
            title="how to clone a repository"
            >clone the repository</a
          >, run the compile script, and
          <a
            href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked"
            title="how to load an unpacked extension"
            >load the unpacked extension into chrome</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The respository is at
          <a href="https://github.com/dfhoughton/amanuensis-2"
            >https://github.com/dfhoughton/amanuensis-2</a
          >.<span class="fn"
            >Why "amanuensis-2"? Because there was an earlier version of this
            extension that worked with an earlier version of the Chrome
            extension spec. That version reached end of life and the extension
            died. This is a thorough rewrite. It is somewhat less ambitious but
            uses more modern tech.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          To run the build script, you must have
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download" title="how to install node"
            >installed node</a
          >. Then, in a terminal, cd to the install directory and run
          <code>npm run release-build</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once things are more buttoned up I will submit Amanuensis to the
          chrome store. An earlier incarnation of it was there before. Then one
          will be able to install it as one does any chrome extension. The
          instructions above will continue to work.
        </p>
        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <h3>Design Constraints</h3>
        <p>
          Amanuensis, like many extensions, lives in a little box in the top
          left corner of the screen. It needs to stay out of the way of the text
          you're reading, so everything needs to compact, minimal, abbreviated.
          We do what we can with tooltips and icons with familiar meanings, but
          if we had more real estate on the screen we would have made other
          choices.

        <h3 id="note">Note</h3>
        <p>
          Notes are the basic unit of Amanuensis. Their creation is its central
          purpose. They collect information about citations. When you highlight
          a bit of text and invoke Amanuensis, it begins a new note for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The various parts of a note are enumerated in
          <a href="#note-figure">the figure</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>lemma</h4>
        <p>
          A note's
          <a
            href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lemma#:~:text=%2C%20lexicography)-,The%20canonical%20form%20of%20an%20inflected%20word,-%3B%20i.e.%2C%20the"
            >lemma</a
          >
          is the canonical form of its various citations. If you are using
          Amanuensis to study English, the you would probably consider the lemma
          of <i>cats</i>, <i>cat's</i>, and <i>cat</i> to be <i>cat</i>.
        </p>
        <h4>save icon</h4>
        <p>
          Click this to save the note. When you begin a note by highlighting
          some text and opening Amanuensis, it is not yet saved.
        </p>
        <h4>language</h4>
        <p>
          Amanuensis uses a Chrome API to guess the language of a particular
          citation from its content and context. There are many more languages
          than Google attempts to recognize, however, and it is not always
          correct in its guess. The language Google guesses is represented as a
          "locale", a two-letter identifier. You can see the locale for Finnish,
          "fi", as a blue badge overlay on the language selector in
          <a href="#note-figure">the figure</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use this guess, you must specify in the configuration tab which
          <a href="#languages">languages</a> you are interested in. Amanuensis
          will attempt to map Google's guess onto these languages. The language
          selector allows you to edit this guess when Amanuensis gets it wrong.
        </p>
        <h4>lemma note</h4>
        <p>
          This is where you writen things that are true for all uses of the
          phrase. Typically, this is the phrase's definition.

        <h4>tags</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="#tags">Tags</a> represent frequently occurring, important
          bits of information. If you hover over a tag, the information it
          represents will appear as a tooltip. Click in this element to add a
          tag.
        </p>
        <h4>links</h4>
        <p>
          Links connect one note to another. In the example shown in
          <a href="#note-figure">the figure</a>, the motivation for linking the
          two notes was that they both contain <i>vallat</i>. You might link
          notes because they are synonyms or antonyms, or for any reason
          whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>Clicking on a link takes you to the note linked.</p>
        <p>
          Links are always bidirectional. If you link <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>,
          <i>b</i> will also be linked to <i>a</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Links are created within the <a href="#dictionary">dictionary</a>. You
          will find each entry has a link icon. This looks like a link in a
          chain. If you click it, you will create a link
          <i>to the current note</i>.

            The citations section of a note: 1) the current citation; 2)
            per-citation options; 3) the action to mark the current citation as
            the default; 4) the action to delete the current citation; 5) a
            citation not currently displayed

        <h4>citations</h4>
        <p>
          Every note has at least one citation. A citation is a use of the
          note's lemma in context. Quite likely until you have been using
          Amanuensis for some time each note will have just the one citation. If
          you have a memory like a steel trap, you will only ever have the one.
          But if you have an ordinary memory, or you find many interesting
          citations, this number will grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have more than one citation, as in
          <a href="#citation-figure">the figure</a>, you may pick a "canonical"
          one to display by default when browsing notes. You may also delete
          citations. You cannot delete the last citation.
        </p>
        <p>
          You only have these options for the currently displayed citation.
          Click on another to display it. 5 in
          <a href="#citation-figure">the figure</a> is a non-selected citation.
          For non-selected citations only the form, any note for that citation,
          and the date it was recorded are displayed.
        </p>
        <h5>citation context</h5>
        <p>
          The citation context is shown for the displayed citation. Its parts
          are enumerated in <a href="#note-figure">the figure</a>. These are the
          title (7), the date the citation was recorded (8), the URL (9), and
          the phrase itself and its surrounding text (10).
        </p>
        <p>
          The title, date, and URL are displayed in abbreviation. If you hover
          over them their full content will appear in a tooltip. In the case of
          the date, this tooltip shows the time of day that the citation was
          recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you click on the URL, Chrome will navigate to this page, where it
          will attempt to highlight the phrase cited and bring it into view. If
          the page has changed since you recorded the citation, highighting the
          original phrase in its original context may not be possible.
        </p>
        <h5>citation note</h5>
        <p>
          Each citation has its own note in which you can record anything
          interesting about the particular citation.
        </p>
        <h5>citation tags</h5>
        <p>Every citation also may have its own tags.</p>

            The elements of the dictionary: 1) the manner of browsing; 2) the
            search form; 3) notes; 4) lemma; 5) lemma note; 6) language; 7)
            merge action; 8) link action; 9) delete action

        </figure>
        <h3 id="dictionary">Dictionary</h3>
        <p>
          The dictionary is where one may browse notes. As shown in
          <a href="#dictionary-figure">the figure</a>, there are three manners
          in which one may browse the dictionary (1): ad hoc search, by
          similarity to the current citation, and by page (URL). Every manner of
          search has a form (2). Every search results in zero or more notes (3).
        </p>
        <p>
          Each note in turn is represented by its lemma (4), its lemma note (5),
          its language (6), and some actions one may take: merge the note with
          the current note &mdash; the note currently displayed in the
          <a href="#note">note tab</a> &mdash; (7), link the note to the current
          note (8), or delete the note (9).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you click on a note in the dictionary, this will take you to the
          <a href="#note">note tab</a>, where the note will be displayed. It is
          now the current note, the note to which other notes displayed in the
          dictionary may be merged or linked.

        <h2>Dedication</h2>
        <p>
          Amanuensis, like most of my projects, is dedicated to my son Jude, who
          died on February 1st, 2023. He was a better programmer and a better,
          kinder, more interesting person than me. I was looking forwarde to
          being surprised and amazed by him as he went out into the world. He
          shared repositories in github under the name
          <a
            href="https://github.com/TurkeyMcMac"
            title="Jude's github repositories"
            >TurkeyMcMac</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>We love you and miss you, Jude.</p>
