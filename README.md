# Amanuensis

This is a reboot of an earlier project, a chrome extension I wrote also called Amanuensis. Manifest v2 died, so that
extension died. I'm rewriting it now in more idiomatic React and using more modern technologies, like indexeddb.

An amanuensis is a literary or artistic assistant. Your amanuensis copies down your art. The amanuensis extension
copies down your thoughts as you browse the web. In particular, it notes phrases you found interesting.

The intended purpose of Amanuensis is to facilitate language acquisition by keeping track of words you needed to
look up. The idea is that retaining words in a useful form requires not only remembering their meaning but the sort
of context they tend to appear in and other words they are used alongside. Amanuensis captures phrases in their
context.

## Installation

Eventually Amanuensis will be in the Chrome extension store again. In the meantime, you will need to install it
as I do as I develop it.

## For Developers

Note that everything gets packaged up by `scripts/build.sh` and put in a `dist` directory.

## Dedication

This, like everything I write, is dedicated to my son Jude, a.k.a. [TurkeyMcMac](https://github.com/turkeymcmac).
He died on February 1st, 2023. He was brilliant, quirky, funny, kind, and generally amazing. He was a better person
than I will ever be. I want people to know that he existed, so I dedicate stuff to him. I love you, Jude.
